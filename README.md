I'm a professional Software Developer who has more than 8 years of career experience. I ‚ù§Ô∏è Javascript and their whole ecosystem. But this doesn't block me to learn new technologies and build amazing projects with a variety of different tools. My main focus is to develop great products for my clients.
Currently, I'm working as a Software Developer at Cooperativa de Trabajo SUBTE, and doing freelance projects on my own.

If you are interested in contact me you can do it by sending me an email fcarocena@gmail.com. I'm pleased to read you and see what you have in mind.
