# Welcome to my <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" width="40" height="40" /> profile üî≠

I'm a professional Software Developer who has more than 8 years of career experience. I ‚ù§Ô∏è Javascript and their whole ecosystem. But this doesn't block me to learn new technologies and build amazing projects with a variety of different tools. My main focus is to develop great products for my clients.
Currently, I'm working as a Software Developer at Cooperativa de Trabajo SUBTE, and doing freelance projects on my own.
